        "info": "Our team explored how Big Data can help improve employee satisfaction. Bloom analyzes collected data from apps like fitbit and social media, and compares it against user defined goals to create a general satisfaction score. An artificial flower then physically displays that score by gradually shifting between full bloom or wilting. This single visual output, matched with zero direct user input outside of setup, was designed with the goal of reducing complexity for the user by instead leveraging Big Data's strengths in collating large sets of already available data."

        "info": "Our team designed a product targeted at first time crypto wallet holders. We based it on similar products created by credit card companies for first time cardholders which are targeted at youths and offer more parental controls. A big concept in cryptocurrency is independence, so our version imagined this user experience as a mentor and mentee relationship, with rewards coming from completing mentor directed goals."
